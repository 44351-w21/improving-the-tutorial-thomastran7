### The improvements that I have implemented are:
- Enabling WASD navigation.
- Changed the background to an animated background.
- Replaced one of the original enemies as a fireball.
- Changed what the player looks like.
- Allows the player to be hit more than once (max health of 3). 
    - Displayed the number of lives with the use of heart on the top left screen.
### DISCLAIMER
- While implementing the lives function. This function create any issue where once the player lost all their lives, the screen never displayed a game over screen, nor did it restart the game. I have tried to troubleshoot this issue, but was not able to find the issue that is causing this to happen.  
### Assets
- The new player was obtained from OpenGameArt
- The fireball enemy's art (tank explosion) was obtained from Kenney.nl
- The heart icons were obtained from OpenGameArt
- The background (bg1) was obtained from OpenGameArt
